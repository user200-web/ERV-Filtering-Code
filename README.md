# Endogenous retroviruses as an explanation for lentiviral restriction in South American primates

This GitHub repository contains the files used in my MBiol project looking for novel ERVs that could have a role in lentiviral restriction in South American primates. This repository contains: 
* The code used to filter the initial HI-FEVER data.
* The files used to complete the selection analysis on Orthogroup 1.
* The DNA and protein alignments of Orthogroup 1-5.
* The full alignment of RNA matches to _gago1_
